# LACC-Chess-Bot
Gonna make a Chess Bot for fun
This will be made in C++ maybe some other scripting languages as well haven't really thought about it.
I'm thinking that the each piece for the chess game will be its own class and than we can duplicate as needed. Each piece will 
have a score as a float/doulbe haven't decided yet probably the latter so we can use it to calculate the game state.
